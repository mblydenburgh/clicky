# Clicky Game

A React based card shuffling game to demo click events, component properties, and state manipulation

## Rules

A set of twelve images will be randomly displayed on the game grid. The player has to select a different card each turn, having their places swapped after each selection. Each valid guess increases the score by 1, while  choosing an already selected picture will end the game and set the score back to 0.
